Twimba - Twitter Clone
This project is a simple Twitter clone called Twimba, which was developed as a part of The Frontend Career Path through Scrimba. It aimed to replicate some of the basic functionalities of Twitter.

Subjects Explored
During the development of Twimba, the following subjects were explored:

Textarea in HTML: The project utilized the <textarea> HTML element to allow users to input their tweets or messages.

.forEach(): The JavaScript .forEach() method was used to iterate over arrays and perform actions on each element. It played a crucial role in handling data and updating the UI in Twimba.

Data Attributes: Twimba made use of data attributes in HTML to store additional information related to elements. This helped in associating relevant data with specific HTML elements.

Conditionally Rendering Styles in JavaScript: JavaScript was used to conditionally apply styles to different elements based on certain conditions. This approach allowed for dynamic styling of the UI elements in response to user interactions.

Logical NOT Operator to Flip Booleans: The logical NOT (!) operator was employed to flip the boolean values of variables. It was particularly useful in toggling the state of certain features or elements in Twimba.

CDNs (Content Delivery Networks): The project relied on CDNs to efficiently serve external libraries or resources. This approach allowed for faster loading times and improved performance.
